# CSS Flex-Cards

This is a demonstration of desktop and mobile-friendly cards designed using [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).\

## Usage and limitations
To use, copy the style section of [flex-card.html](flex-card.html), and use the html section to guide formatting. Tweak to taste.\
To limit card height and make content scrollable, use `.content-scrollable` as an extra div class for your description.\
The styling and colour has not yet been paramaterized or themed.\
Cards will work with or without images.

## TODO
* Fully parameterize colours and theming
* Merge and simplify scrollable content
* Remove gold line
